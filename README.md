# PocketPony
Feed and pet your pony! Her mood changes, she blinks and sleeps.
Modes: external hunger timer, built-in hunger timer, disable hunger, disable escape.
Yes, if you donâ€™t feed a pony for a long time, then she will prefer to find a more caring owner and run off into the sunset :)
If you tease her with a muffin for a long time, she will begin to suspect something...
If you pet her, she squints quite a bit.
